## Notes for Code Output
- All classes and methods **must include docstrings**. Module-level docstrings are not required. Descriptions of class attributes should be provided in the constructor's docstring.
- Docstrings must always be concise and written entirely in English using **Google style**.
- All comments must be written in English. Avoid overly complex or unnecessarily difficult language.
- The project is configured with strict settings for **ruff** and **mypy**. Please refer to `pyproject.toml` for details.
